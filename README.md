It includes essential information about the course, such as its description, objectives, and required materials. Please read through this document to familiarize yourself with the course content and expectations.

## Course Description

This course continues the material from Python Programming beginning with lists and basic
structures. Then, the focus moves toward Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that includes topics
such as objects, classes, encapsulation, abstraction modularity, memory management, inheritance,
and polymorphism. Advanced Python language features like iterators, generators, lambdas, and
comprehensions are also covered.


## CLOs

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Analyze, design, implement, and test moderately complex problems
- Implement solutions using the Object Oriented Programming Paradigm (OOP):
> - encapsulation
> - polymorphism
> - inheritance
> - abstraction
> - modularity
- Utilize data types to model complex data structures (e.g., list, dictionary, class)
- Develop programs according to a coding standard
- Handle code errors and exceptions adequately
